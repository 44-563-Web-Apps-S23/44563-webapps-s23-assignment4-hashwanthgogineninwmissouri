            THE GAZING GLOBE           _Eugene Pillot_
        </h3>
        <h5>ZAMA.</h5> 
        <p>It be not for me to say, child; but I do be thinking you moon at
        that evil ball too much. It do make your sight grow red! It be not wise
        to know an enchanted thing so well.</p>

        <h5>OHANO.</h5>
        <p>If that gazing globe in the garden would only show me the way to
        my heart's desire, how gladly would I be the victim of its enchantment!</p>

        <h5>ZAMA.</h5> 
        <p>Nijo's kiss do be your enchantment, child. One touch of his lips
        and you do be forgetting all else.</p>

        <h5>OHANO.</h5> 
        <p>If Nijo's kiss can make me forget this fever within me, I want
        his kiss as I shall never want anything else in all of this life. I want
        it!!</p>

        <p>[_Approaching horse's hoofs are heard from off right._</p>

        <h5>ZAMA.</h5> 
        <p>Listen--the horse! Ohano, your lover do be coming!</p>

        <h5>OHANO.</h5> 
        <p>[_Running to the window._] Already? He must have taken the short
        way through the cliffs.</p>

        <h5>ZAMA.</h5>
        <p>Ah, child, do you not be excited as a bird in a storm-wind's
        blow?</p>
