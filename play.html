        THE GAZING GLOBE           _Eugene Pillot_

        <p>
            ZAMA. It be not for me to say, child; but I do be thinking you moon at
            that evil ball too much. It do make your sight grow red! It be not wise
            to know an enchanted thing so well.<br>

            OHANO. If that gazing globe in the garden would only show me the way to
            my heart's desire, how gladly would I be the victim of its enchantment!<br>

            ZAMA. Nijo's kiss do be your enchantment, child. One touch of his lips
            and you do be forgetting all else.<br>

            OHANO. If Nijo's kiss can make me forget this fever within me, I want
            his kiss as I shall never want anything else in all of this life. I want
            it!!<br>

                [_Approaching horse's hoofs are heard from off right._<br>

            ZAMA. Listen--the horse! Ohano, your lover do be coming!<br>

            OHANO. [_Running to the window._] Already? He must have taken the short
            way through the cliffs.<br>

            ZAMA. Ah, child, do you not be excited as a bird in a storm-wind's
            blow?<br>
